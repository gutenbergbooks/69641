    It was Christmas Eve, of all nights in the year,
    And old Schneider Von Groot, who was full of good cheer,
    Was seeking his home, like a jolly old elf,
    And was singing a drinking song all to himself,
    Of the glories of beer, and of schnapps, and of wine,--
    Of the draught that makes mortal clay feel so divine,--
    Of the drink that drowns sorrow, misfortune and care--
    Before which life’s ills vanish into thin air.
    He sat down by the wayside; his pipe he pulled out;
    And he filled it, and lit it, and giving a shout,
    He lay back on the bank as he puffed away care--
    For he felt not the chill of the frosty night air;
    But gently and peacefully sank into rest,
    And enjoyed for the time the sweet sleep of the blest.
    He was soon into dreamland, and the first thing he saw
    Was a queer little elf with a book of the law.
    The page it lay open, and what do you think
    Was the law? It was written that all men should drink.
    Not water or milk, but the strongest of schnapps;
    Such as Dutchmen for ages have used for night caps.
    The schnapps flowed in rivers. Each man could afford
    Every day in the year to get drunk as a lord.
    The schnapps it cost nothing on land or on sea,
    And says Schneider Von Groot, “it’s the country for me.
    I’ll never get sober, but always keep tight,
    And I’ll drink like a fish from the morning till night.”

    And while he was speaking, a little old chap,
    Who looked then as though he’d just woke from a nap,
    Climbed up on his face and sat down on his nose,
    And two little demons were perched on his toes.
    One got in each ear, and one sat in each eye;
    And no matter how much he might struggle or try,
    They would not shake off, but they stuck fast as glue,
    And then he discovered the villainous crew
    Were all drunk as pipers, and ready to fight,
    And poor Schneider Von Groot was all trembling with fright
    When the battle began, and he wished himself back
    With the old Burgomaster, Von Gilder Von Schack.

    The fiends bound him with wythes of the willow and fir;
    And they tied him so fast that the man couldn’t stir.
    So they struggled and fought till the wounded and dead
    On his body lay thick from his heels to his head,
    And though thousands were slaughtered, the ranks were supplied
    By new thousands who fought for the men who had died.
    And the battle raged hot, till the dark clouds of night
    Brought peace to Von Groot at the close of the fight.

    While Von Groot lay and thought if he ever should see
    Frau Von Groot and the children by old Zuyder Zee,
    A little green imp with a bright, gleaming knife,
    Jumped up on his breast, and he thought that his life
    Was sure come to an end; but the little green man
    To cut all the wythes that had bound him began;
    And before he as much as “I thank you” could say,
    The imp cut his stick and then bounded away.

    Von Groot then got up, and when looking around
    Saw the dead that lay scattered about on the ground,
    And he said to himself, “I should just like to know
    The cause of this slaughter.” A voice from below
    Cried hoarsely, “It’s schnapps, and the blackness of hell.
    All its murders, its crimes and its sorrows can tell.”
    Then the earth shook beneath him with thunderous raps,
    And a chorus of demons yelled, “schnapps! murder! schnapps!”

    While he looked in the sky he saw floating afar
    An angel who sat in a rich golden car,
    And who guided a beautiful butterfly team.
    She was fair as a lily and bright as a dream,
    And she said to Von Schneider, “my friend, take a ride.
    Just jump into my car and sit down by my side.
    There is nobody here, my dear friend, but ourselves,
    And I’ll bear you away to the land of the elves.”

    As Von Groot obeyed quickly, they rose to the sky,
    And the beautiful car through the air seemed to fly.
    And at last in the distance what should he behold
    But beautiful mountains all crimson and gold--
    Fair fields and rich meadows, where fat gentle kine
    Reposed in the shade of the sheltering vine.
    The fields they were golden with ripe waving wheat,
    And the odor of flowers rich, balmy and sweet,
    Lulled the senses to soft and delicious repose,
    And the sounds of sweet music around them arose.
    He listened and wondered, and then said “perhaps
    There is something to drink here that’s better than schnapps.”

    “Oh, yes,” said the angel, “come hither with me,
    And a drink that is better than schnapps you shall see.
    It flows from a rock here all limpid and pure,
    And most of life’s ills it will certainly cure.
    It will bring you no sorrow, misfortune or grief.
    Just try it, Von Groot, and it is my belief,
    After testing its virtue, my dear friend, perhaps
    You’ll admit there is something much better than schnapps.”

    In a goblet of gold the elixer was brought.
    He grasped it and drank it, and certainly thought
    That new life through his nerves and his heart seemed to thrill.
    “Drink, drink,” said the angel, “don’t fear; drink your fill.
    Behind this elixir there are no mishaps.
    You’ll find it, Von Schneider, much better than schnapps.”

    There was then a loud clang, and just judge his surprise,
    As Von Groot sat there wondering and rubbing his eyes;
    And Von said to himself, “now, it really don’t seem
    What I’ve passed through to-night can be only a dream.”
    The soft Christmas chimes then rang out loud and clear,
    Like a sweet benediction saying “be of good cheer;
    Be a man, drink no schnapps, and go home to your wife--
    Stick to water, my boy, for the rest of your life.
    The little green imps that you saw here last night
    Were all made of schnapps and I hope that the fright
    That they gave you will save you for ever and aye.”
    “Oh, yes,” says Von Schneider, “to schnapps now good-bye.”

    He rose from the bank; he was shivering with cold,
    And he felt like a mummy a thousand years old.
    He thought of Frau Groot and his dear little boys;
    So he got a big basket of candies and toys,
    And he hurried home quick to his dear little wife.
    She kissed him and hugged him, and said “my dear life,
    Where have you been all night?” And he said, “Santa-Claus.”
    She replied, “say no more, my dear husband, because
    You’ve been drinking, you know.” And he answered, “perhaps
    Just one drink too much, my dear angel, of schnapps.

    “I’ve passed a bad night, and I certainly think
    That schnapps, wife, is not just the best thing to drink.
    It is Christmas day, and at least for one year,
    Or until the next Christmas chimes you shall hear,
    I’ll drink no more schnapps.” On the lips of his wife
    He imprinted a kiss. For the rest of his life
    He was sober and merry, and each Christmas time,
    As he heard the sweet sounds of the holiday chime,
    He remembered his dream, and the terrible fright
    That he got from his schnapps on that Christmas night.

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
