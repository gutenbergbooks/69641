<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was Christmas Eve, of all nights in the year,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And old Schneider Von Groot, who was full of good cheer,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was seeking his home, like a jolly old elf,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And was singing a drinking song all to himself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the glories of beer, and of schnapps, and of wine,&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the draught that makes mortal clay feel so divine,&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the drink that drowns sorrow, misfortune and care&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before which life’s ills vanish into thin air.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He sat down by the wayside; his pipe he pulled out;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he filled it, and lit it, and giving a shout,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He lay back on the bank as he puffed away care&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For he felt not the chill of the frosty night air;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But gently and peacefully sank into rest,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And enjoyed for the time the sweet sleep of the blest.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_2">{2}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He was soon into dreamland, and the first thing he saw<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was a queer little elf with a book of the law.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The page it lay open, and what do you think<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was the law? It was written that all men should drink.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not water or milk, but the strongest of schnapps;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such as Dutchmen for ages have used for night caps.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The schnapps flowed in rivers. Each man could afford<br></span>
<span class="i0">Every day in the year to get drunk as a lord.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The schnapps it cost nothing on land or on sea,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And says Schneider Von Groot, “it’s the country for me.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll never get sober, but always keep tight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I’ll drink like a fish from the morning till night.”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And while he was speaking, a little old chap,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who looked then as though he’d just woke from a nap,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Climbed up on his face and sat down on his nose,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And two little demons were perched on his toes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">One got in each ear, and one sat in each eye;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And no matter how much he might struggle or try,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They would not shake off, but they stuck fast as glue,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And then he discovered the villainous crew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were all drunk as pipers, and ready to fight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And poor Schneider Von Groot was all trembling with fright<br></span>
<span class="i0">When the battle began, and he wished himself back<br></span>
<span class="i0">With the old Burgomaster, Von Gilder Von Schack.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_3">{3}</a></span><br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The fiends bound him with wythes of the willow and fir;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And they tied him so fast that the man couldn’t stir.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So they struggled and fought till the wounded and dead<br></span>
<span class="i0">On his body lay thick from his heels to his head,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And though thousands were slaughtered, the ranks were supplied<br></span>
<span class="i0">By new thousands who fought for the men who had died.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the battle raged hot, till the dark clouds of night<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brought peace to Von Groot at the close of the fight.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While Von Groot lay and thought if he ever should see<br></span>
<span class="i0">Frau Von Groot and the children by old Zuyder Zee,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A little green imp with a bright, gleaming knife,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jumped up on his breast, and he thought that his life<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was sure come to an end; but the little green man<br></span>
<span class="i0">To cut all the wythes that had bound him began;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And before he as much as “I thank you” could say,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The imp cut his stick and then bounded away.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Von Groot then got up, and when looking around<br></span>
<span class="i0">Saw the dead that lay scattered about on the ground,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he said to himself, “I should just like to know<br></span>
<span class="i0">The cause of this slaughter.” A voice from below<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cried hoarsely, “It’s schnapps, and the blackness of hell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">All its murders, its crimes and its sorrows can tell.”<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then the earth shook beneath him with thunderous raps,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a chorus of demons yelled, “schnapps! murder! schnapps!<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_4">{4}</a></span>”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While he looked in the sky he saw floating afar<br></span>
<span class="i0">An angel who sat in a rich golden car,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And who guided a beautiful butterfly team.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She was fair as a lily and bright as a dream,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And she said to Von Schneider, “my friend, take a ride.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Just jump into my car and sit down by my side.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There is nobody here, my dear friend, but ourselves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I’ll bear you away to the land of the elves.”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As Von Groot obeyed quickly, they rose to the sky,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the beautiful car through the air seemed to fly.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And at last in the distance what should he behold<br></span>
<span class="i0">But beautiful mountains all crimson and gold&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fair fields and rich meadows, where fat gentle kine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reposed in the shade of the sheltering vine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fields they were golden with ripe waving wheat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the odor of flowers rich, balmy and sweet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lulled the senses to soft and delicious repose,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the sounds of sweet music around them arose.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He listened and wondered, and then said “perhaps<br></span>
<span class="i0">There is something to drink here that’s better than schnapps.”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, yes,” said the angel, “come hither with me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a drink that is better than schnapps you shall see.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It flows from a rock here all limpid and pure,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And most of life’s ills it will certainly cure.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_5">{5}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">It will bring you no sorrow, misfortune or grief.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Just try it, Von Groot, and it is my belief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">After testing its virtue, my dear friend, perhaps<br></span>
<span class="i0">You’ll admit there is something much better than schnapps.”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In a goblet of gold the elixer was brought.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He grasped it and drank it, and certainly thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">That new life through his nerves and his heart seemed to thrill.<br></span>
<span class="i0">“Drink, drink,” said the angel, “don’t fear; drink your fill.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Behind this elixir there are no mishaps.<br></span>
<span class="i0">You’ll find it, Von Schneider, much better than schnapps.”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was then a loud clang, and just judge his surprise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As Von Groot sat there wondering and rubbing his eyes;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Von said to himself, “now, it really don’t seem<br></span>
<span class="i0">What I’ve passed through to-night can be only a dream.”<br></span>
<span class="i0">The soft Christmas chimes then rang out loud and clear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like a sweet benediction saying “be of good cheer;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Be a man, drink no schnapps, and go home to your wife&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stick to water, my boy, for the rest of your life.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The little green imps that you saw here last night<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were all made of schnapps and I hope that the fright<br></span>
<span class="i0">That they gave you will save you for ever and aye.”<br></span>
<span class="i0">“Oh, yes,” says Von Schneider, “to schnapps now good-bye.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_6">{6}</a></span>”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He rose from the bank; he was shivering with cold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he felt like a mummy a thousand years old.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He thought of Frau Groot and his dear little boys;<br></span>
<span class="i0">So he got a big basket of candies and toys,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he hurried home quick to his dear little wife.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She kissed him and hugged him, and said “my dear life,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where have you been all night?” And he said, “Santa-Claus.”<br></span>
<span class="i0">She replied, “say no more, my dear husband, because<br></span>
<span class="i0">You’ve been drinking, you know.” And he answered, “perhaps<br></span>
<span class="i0">Just one drink too much, my dear angel, of schnapps.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I’ve passed a bad night, and I certainly think<br></span>
<span class="i0">That schnapps, wife, is not just the best thing to drink.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It is Christmas day, and at least for one year,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or until the next Christmas chimes you shall hear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll drink no more schnapps.” On the lips of his wife<br></span>
<span class="i0">He imprinted a kiss. For the rest of his life<br></span>
<span class="i0">He was sober and merry, and each Christmas time,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As he heard the sweet sounds of the holiday chime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He remembered his dream, and the terrible fright<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he got from his schnapps on that Christmas night.<br></span>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
