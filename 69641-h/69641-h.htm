<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was Christmas Eve, of all nights in the year,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And old Schneider Von Groot, who was full of good cheer,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was seeking his home, like a jolly old elf,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And was singing a drinking song all to himself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the glories of beer, and of schnapps, and of wine,&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the draught that makes mortal clay feel so divine,&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the drink that drowns sorrow, misfortune and care&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before which life’s ills vanish into thin air.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He sat down by the wayside; his pipe he pulled out;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he filled it, and lit it, and giving a shout,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He lay back on the bank as he puffed away care&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For he felt not the chill of the frosty night air;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But gently and peacefully sank into rest,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And enjoyed for the time the sweet sleep of the blest.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_2">{2}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He was soon into dreamland, and the first thing he saw<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was a queer little elf with a book of the law.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The page it lay open, and what do you think<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was the law? It was written that all men should drink.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not water or milk, but the strongest of schnapps;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such as Dutchmen for ages have used for night caps.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The schnapps flowed in rivers. Each man could afford<br></span>
<span class="i0">Every day in the year to get drunk as a lord.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The schnapps it cost nothing on land or on sea,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And says Schneider Von Groot, “it’s the country for me.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll never get sober, but always keep tight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I’ll drink like a fish from the morning till night.”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And while he was speaking, a little old chap,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who looked then as though he’d just woke from a nap,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Climbed up on his face and sat down on his nose,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And two little demons were perched on his toes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">One got in each ear, and one sat in each eye;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And no matter how much he might struggle or try,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They would not shake off, but they stuck fast as glue,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And then he discovered the villainous crew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were all drunk as pipers, and ready to fight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And poor Schneider Von Groot was all trembling with fright<br></span>
<span class="i0">When the battle began, and he wished himself back<br></span>
<span class="i0">With the old Burgomaster, Von Gilder Von Schack.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_3">{3}</a></span><br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The fiends bound him with wythes of the willow and fir;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And they tied him so fast that the man couldn’t stir.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So they struggled and fought till the wounded and dead<br></span>
<span class="i0">On his body lay thick from his heels to his head,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And though thousands were slaughtered, the ranks were supplied<br></span>
<span class="i0">By new thousands who fought for the men who had died.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the battle raged hot, till the dark clouds of night<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brought peace to Von Groot at the close of the fight.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While Von Groot lay and thought if he ever should see<br></span>
<span class="i0">Frau Von Groot and the children by old Zuyder Zee,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A little green imp with a bright, gleaming knife,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jumped up on his breast, and he thought that his life<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was sure come to an end; but the little green man<br></span>
<span class="i0">To cut all the wythes that had bound him began;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And before he as much as “I thank you” could say,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The imp cut his stick and then bounded away.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Von Groot then got up, and when looking around<br></span>
<span class="i0">Saw the dead that lay scattered about on the ground,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he said to himself, “I should just like to know<br></span>
<span class="i0">The cause of this slaughter.” A voice from below<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cried hoarsely, “It’s schnapps, and the blackness of hell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">All its murders, its crimes and its sorrows can tell.”<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then the earth shook beneath him with thunderous raps,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a chorus of demons yelled, “schnapps! murder! schnapps!<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_4">{4}</a></span>”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While he looked in the sky he saw floating afar<br></span>
<span class="i0">An angel who sat in a rich golden car,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And who guided a beautiful butterfly team.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She was fair as a lily and bright as a dream,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And she said to Von Schneider, “my friend, take a ride.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Just jump into my car and sit down by my side.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There is nobody here, my dear friend, but ourselves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I’ll bear you away to the land of the elves.”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As Von Groot obeyed quickly, they rose to the sky,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the beautiful car through the air seemed to fly.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And at last in the distance what should he behold<br></span>
<span class="i0">But beautiful mountains all crimson and gold&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fair fields and rich meadows, where fat gentle kine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reposed in the shade of the sheltering vine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fields they were golden with ripe waving wheat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the odor of flowers rich, balmy and sweet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lulled the senses to soft and delicious repose,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the sounds of sweet music around them arose.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He listened and wondered, and then said “perhaps<br></span>
<span class="i0">There is something to drink here that’s better than schnapps.”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, yes,” said the angel, “come hither with me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a drink that is better than schnapps you shall see.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It flows from a rock here all limpid and pure,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And most of life’s ills it will certainly cure.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_5">{5}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">It will bring you no sorrow, misfortune or grief.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Just try it, Von Groot, and it is my belief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">After testing its virtue, my dear friend, perhaps<br></span>
<span class="i0">You’ll admit there is something much better than schnapps.”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In a goblet of gold the elixer was brought.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He grasped it and drank it, and certainly thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">That new life through his nerves and his heart seemed to thrill.<br></span>
<span class="i0">“Drink, drink,” said the angel, “don’t fear; drink your fill.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Behind this elixir there are no mishaps.<br></span>
<span class="i0">You’ll find it, Von Schneider, much better than schnapps.”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was then a loud clang, and just judge his surprise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As Von Groot sat there wondering and rubbing his eyes;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Von said to himself, “now, it really don’t seem<br></span>
<span class="i0">What I’ve passed through to-night can be only a dream.”<br></span>
<span class="i0">The soft Christmas chimes then rang out loud and clear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like a sweet benediction saying “be of good cheer;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Be a man, drink no schnapps, and go home to your wife&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stick to water, my boy, for the rest of your life.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The little green imps that you saw here last night<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were all made of schnapps and I hope that the fright<br></span>
<span class="i0">That they gave you will save you for ever and aye.”<br></span>
<span class="i0">“Oh, yes,” says Von Schneider, “to schnapps now good-bye.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_6">{6}</a></span>”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He rose from the bank; he was shivering with cold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he felt like a mummy a thousand years old.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He thought of Frau Groot and his dear little boys;<br></span>
<span class="i0">So he got a big basket of candies and toys,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he hurried home quick to his dear little wife.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She kissed him and hugged him, and said “my dear life,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where have you been all night?” And he said, “Santa-Claus.”<br></span>
<span class="i0">She replied, “say no more, my dear husband, because<br></span>
<span class="i0">You’ve been drinking, you know.” And he answered, “perhaps<br></span>
<span class="i0">Just one drink too much, my dear angel, of schnapps.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I’ve passed a bad night, and I certainly think<br></span>
<span class="i0">That schnapps, wife, is not just the best thing to drink.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It is Christmas day, and at least for one year,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or until the next Christmas chimes you shall hear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll drink no more schnapps.” On the lips of his wife<br></span>
<span class="i0">He imprinted a kiss. For the rest of his life<br></span>
<span class="i0">He was sober and merry, and each Christmas time,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As he heard the sweet sounds of the holiday chime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He remembered his dream, and the terrible fright<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he got from his schnapps on that Christmas night.<br></span>
